By: `W13-1`      Since: `Sept 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Security,*`Security`*>>: Enforces Authentication

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]

[[Events-Driven-Nature]]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::designSecurity[]
[[Design-Security]]
=== Security component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::SecurityClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/security/Security.java[`Security.java`]

The `Security` component is an authentication module that ensures the users that are using the application are
recognized, and an instance of a authenticated user will be created every time a user is logged in so as to allow
the application to do user-specific tasks.

The Sequence Diagram when a user logs in is given below:

.Interactions between the UI Component and Security Component for the `login` Command
image::SecurityLoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::designSecurity[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Interactions between the Logic Component and Model Component for the `undo` Command
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable feature
==== Current implementation

FreeTime's timetable feature allows users to store and view their own timetables. +

FreeTime can also display a deconflicted timetable, highlighting mutually free timeslots among the current user and all other selected people.

The timetable feature can be broadly split into two parts: +
1. The backend, which handles the storage and logic of `TimeTable` objects; +
2. The frontend, which handles the display of `TimeTable` objects.

===== Backend implementation

The `TimeTable` object is composed under the `Person` class in `Model`. Each `TimeTable` is composed of any number of `TimeSlot` objects. Each `TimeSlot` consists of: +
1. One `DayOfWeek` object to indicate the day of week of the `TimeSlot`; +
2. Two `LocalTime` objects to indicate the start time and end time of the `TimeSlot` respectively. +
3. One `Color` object to indicate the color of the `TimeSlot` when displayed on FreeTime's UI.

The following class diagram summarises the relationship between the components of the TimeTable class:

.Structure of the TimeTable Class
image::TimeTableClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

The `TimeTable` class implements two key methods: +
1. `TimeTable#addTimeSlot()` - to add a new `TimeSlot` to the `TimeTable` +
2. `TimeTable#deleteTimeSlot()` - to remove an existing `TimeSlot` from the `TimeTable` +

The class `DeconflictTimeTable`, which inherits from `TimeTable`, is used to display mutually free timeslots among users. +

The key difference between `TimeTable` and `DeconflictTimeTable` lies in the implementation of the `addTimeSlot()` method. `TimeTable#addTimeSlot()` throws an exception when the `TimeSlot` to be added overlaps with an existing `TimeSlot` in the `TimeTable`. However, `DeconflictTimeTable#addTimeSlot()` merges the `TimeSlot` to be added with all overlapping `TimeSlot` objects in the `TimeTable`.

The following sequence diagram shows the significant method calls for generating a `DeconflictTimeTable` object from two `TimeTable` objects:

.Sequence Diagram Showing the Generation of a `DeconflictTimeTable`
image::DeconflictSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Frontend implementation

`TimeTablePanel` extends the abstract class `UIPart` and is implemented using a `BorderPane`. It is composed of the following classes: +
1. `TimeTableDayMarkerGrid` - a `GridPane` on the left of the `TimeTablePanel` to display the days of the week; +
2. `TimeTableTimeMarkerGrid` - a `GridPane` on the top of the `TimeTablePanel` to display the time markers +
3. `TimeTableMainGrid` - a `GridPane` in the center of the `TimeTablePanel`. Composed of any number of `TimeTablePanelTimeSlot` objects. +

The following screenshot shows the relative position of all the components in `TimeTablePanel`:

.Layout of the TimeTablePanel
image::TimeTableScreenshotLabelled.png[width="800"]


===== Interaction between backend and frontend

The following sequence diagram show the significant method calls for the execution of the `addtime` command. The execution of the `deletetime` is implemented in a similar manner.

.Sequence Diagram Showing the Execution of an `addtime` Command
image::TimeTableSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

{nbsp}


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the frontend updates the `TimeTable` to be displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Clears the entire `TimeTableMainGrid` before loading the new `TimeTable`
** Pros: Easy to implement, only one method (`loadTimeTable()`) is required
** Cons: May suffer from performance degradation, especially when the `TimeTable` to be loaded contains many `TimeSlot` objects
* **Alternative 2:** Detect the difference between the currently displayed `TimeTable` before adding or deleting `TimeTablePanelTimeSlot` objects accordingly.
** Pros: Reduces execution time of methods which update the displayed `TimeTable`
** Cons: A method to detect the difference between `TimeTable` objects must be implemented. May not result in significant performance improvements when switching between `TimeTable` objects with few or no `TimeSlot` objects in common.
// end::timetable[]

{nbsp}

// tag::import_export_timetable[]
=== Import and Export timetable feature

The import and export timetable feature allows users to import and export their timetables from/to external applications as _.ics_ files.

The currently supported applications are: +

Import:

* NUSMODS [https://nusmods.com] +

Export:

* FreeTime (you export and then import it back in)

* Google Calendar (Preliminary support: TimeSlots show up as individual events for 1 week.)

==== Current implementation

The import and export feature consists of two parts: +

1. The backend, which handles the reading and writing of _.ics_ files, and the conversion between the _.ics_ format and the TimeTable object. +
2. The frontend, which parses user input, and informs the user of success or failure.


===== Backend implementation - Import

For import, the file is read from the disk using biweekly (3rd-party library), and then subsequently converted into a TimeTable by the IcsUtil class.

The following sequence diagram shows how the TimeTable is imported: +

.Interactions between the Logic Component and IcsUtil for the `import` Command
image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[ ]

===== Backend implementation - Export

For export, the TimeTable is converted into a iCalendar object by IcsUtil, and then written to disk as _.ics_ file using biweekly (3rd-party library).

The following sequence diagram shows how the TimeTable is exported: +

.Interactions between the Logic Component and IcsUtil for the `export` Command
image::ImportSequenceDiagrsssam.png[width = 600]

{nbsp}

===== Backend implementation - IcsUtil Class

The `IcsUtil` class implements two key utility methods for handling _.ics_ files: +

1. `IcsUtil#readTimeTableFromFile()` - to read an `Optional<TimeTable>` from an _.ics_ file; accepts the `filePath` of the _.ics_ file as parameter +
2. `IcsUtil#saveTimeTableToFile()` - to write a `TimeTable` to disk; accepts the `TimeTable` and `filePath` of the _.ics_ file as parameter +


===== Frontend implementation
Similar to the other commands; see <<Events-Driven-Nature,*`Events-Driven nature of the design`*>>.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Which Classes (and which system(s)) should parse the ics file format?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All code related to parsing _.ics_ timetable files are inside 'IcsUtil' class. When executing ImportCommand/ExportCommand, it directly calls a method in IcsUtil.
** Pros:
*** All methods that have to do with _.ics_ parsing are in one class. Easier to implement and manage, given that there are only a few methods for now.
*** Less dependencies. (directly call IcsUtil to read/write .ics files; compared to having to call IcsStorage which then calls IcsUtil).
** Cons:
*** Single responsibility principle is broken. Also, difficult to manage if the class expands and has more methods.
* **Alternative 2 (Go through the <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> subsystem):** Follow the existing IO implementation of the other files: `addressbook.xml` and `preferences.json`; create an IcsTimeTableStorage class to access the ics file in hard disk.
** Pros:
*** Similar implementation to existing: Classes that have to do with IO are accessed using the Storage Interface.
** Cons:
*** Increased dependency: LogicManager will then have dependency on Storage.
*** More difficult to implement: Current implementation of <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> does not favor 'on-demand' instantiation (as in the import and export command).

{nbsp}

// tag::securityImplementation[]
=== Security Implementation
To begin this section, we would need to introduce the idea of a Authenticated User instance.
Everytime a user successfully logs in, or creates a new account, the application will create an Authenticated User in
Model. This User is an extension of the Person Class, which different UI and commands will access it. One example would
be the friend's UI panel, where it has to know the current user to know his friends

==== Current Implementation
This section will be broken down into +
1. Front-End +
2. Back-End +

===== Front-End Implementation
1. CLI +
SecurityBox Class handles the command line interface, and passes every commands to
SecurityManager through the Security API.
2. UI Prompt +
Inside the UI package, there are two new windows created, LoginWindow and RegistrationWindow. Each Window would handle
UI events such as clicks and passing relevant information to the SecurityManager
similar to above. +

Whenever login or register is called through the Security API, this raises their respective Events to the event bus. The preexisting UIManager is subscribed
to this events, and will react accordingly to the events raised.

===== Back-End Implementation
Users credentials are stored in a json file called users.json at root. The class managing the reading and writing of
this file is JsonAppUserStorage. +

The object that it is storing is the AppUsers class implemented in the Security Package. It contains an array of
AccountCredentials, which has the attribute of Username and Password, and methods such isPasswordValid(). Here it also
calls the static Hasher class, which takes the password and a salt to create the hash of the password to store.

Whenever a user logs in, the username is searched inside AppUsers. Once it matches the username, the input pasword is
then salted and hashed (SHA-512), and finally compared to the stored hashed password.

==== Design Considerations
// end::securityImplementation[]

// tag::friend[]
=== Friend feature
==== Feature description
The friend feature allows users to befriend and add other users to their friend list.
Timetables are only viewable for users in your friend list and timetables can only be deconflicted within your friends.

==== Current implementation
The feature is implemented with two main parts. The frontend and the backend, which will be explained below.

===== Backend implementation
The `User` is associated with a specific `Person`. Each person can have any number of `Friend` objects.
Every friend will have a `Name` object that corresponds to the specific `Person` object in the list.


.Class diagram of Friend
image::FriendClassDiagram.png[width="200"]

{nbsp}

===== Frontend implementation
On the left side users will now see two panes, one above for friends and one below for the rest of the users not inside the friend list.
PersonListPanel is adapted to now have two `Stackpane` instead of one and is nested inside a `Splitpane` in the `VBox`.

.Class diagram of Friend
image::FriendFeatureFrontEndDiagram.png[width="300"]

===== Design Considerations
===== How to store the friends of the User
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Every Friend of the user has a name which matches a specific person in the database
** Pros: Every friend only includes essential information about the specific person
** Cons: Takes longer to match the person in the friends list to a person in the database
* **Alternative 2:** Allowing every Friend to compose a Person object
** Pros: Friend contains more information that can be used
** Cons: Duplicated entries of the same Person
// end::friend[]

{nbsp}

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]

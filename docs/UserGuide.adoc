== Introduction

_FreeTime_ is a desktop app that allows you to *find free timeslots to meet team members for projects*. More specifically, it helps you identify the times during which everyone you want to meet is free.
_FreeTime_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `FreeTime.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  You should be on the FreeTime's login screen, as follows:
+
.Window of FreeTime during first start-up

+
.  If it is the first time you are using the app, follow the instructions on-screen to create your account and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
+
****
Creating account example: +

`register Paul 123` +

Creates an account name _Paul_ with password _123_
****

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Each command has an alias (given in round brackets after the command word) that can be used to replace the full command word. e.g. `find John` is equivaluent to `f John`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

// tag::security[]
=== Security

The timetable content is locked, and it requires a user to either login with a pre-existing account, or register a new one.

NOTE: The application has a default user with username: *test* and password: *test*

There are five security related commands that can be entered on this command line:

1. `login`
2. `register`
3. `ui`
4. `logout` (Only when you have logged in)
5. `exit`

.Login Page with Command Prompts
image::LoginPage.png[width="790"]

At this page you will have to enter your credentials to log in. Only then would you be able to edit and view your own timetable,
and view your friends' timetable. +

TIP: Friends are other users that you have "friended", and all users start off without
having any friends. +

The timetable that belongs to users that are not your friends will not be available to you, till you
add them as friends.

==== Logging In: `login`
Command: `login [username] [password]`

Examples:

* `login test test` +
 Logins with Username: test and Password: test

* `login tim tam` +
Logins with Username: tim and Password: tam

CAUTION: Constraints: +
* Username and Password must not contain any spaces

==== Registering: `register`
Command: `register [Username] [Password] [Email] [MobilePhone] [Address]`

Examples:

* register tim tam tim@tam.com 88888888 Tammy

CAUTION: Constraints: +
* Currently all fields must not have spaces too +
* All fields must be entered

==== Showing the UI Interface: `ui`
Command: `ui`

image::RegisterUI.png[width="790"]

==== Logging Out : `logout`
Command: `logout`

To be able to use this command, you would have to be logged in in the first place. Referring to the figure 4, there is
a logout button on the menu bar at the top of the application. Clicking on that would have the same effect as typing the
command `logout`.

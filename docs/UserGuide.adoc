== Introduction
Welcome to _FreeTime_!

_FreeTime_ is a desktop app that allows you to *find free timeslots to meet team members for projects*. More specifically, it helps you identify the times during which everyone you want to meet is free.
_FreeTime_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `FreeTime.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Registering and Logging In

Whenever you open the application, the timetable content and commands are locked. You are required to either
login with a pre-existing account, or register a new one.

image::StartUpScreenFix.png[width="790"]

At this page you will have to enter your credentials to log in. Only then would you be able to edit and view your own timetable,
and view your friends' timetable. +

TIP: Friends are other users that you have "friended", and all users start off without
having any friends. +

The timetable that belongs to users that are not your friends will not be available for you to see, till you
add them as friends.

Command: `register u/[Username] pw/[Password] e/[Email] p/[MobilePhone] a/[Address]`

Examples:

* `register u/tim pw/tam e/tim@tam.com p/88888888 a/Tammy Road`

NOTE: Only the `Username` and `Password` fields are necessary, the others are optional and
you are not required to enter them.

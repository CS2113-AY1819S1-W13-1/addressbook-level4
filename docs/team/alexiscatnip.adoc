= PROJECT: FreeTime

---

== Overview

|===
*This project was done in my second year at university, as part of a module on Software Engineering.*
|===

FreeTime is the end-product of my CS2113T project. Our team was given a existing project (AddressBook 4) to morph to something different that targets a group of users. We chose to target students.

FreeTime is a Time-Planner application. It is primarily aimed at Students who need to collaborate with their peers, but find manually comparing timetables a hassle. +

The user interacts with it using a command-line interface (CLI), but it also has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. +

The changes that we have done can be seen in the picture below:

== Summary of contributions
|===
This section summarises my personal contributions to this team project.
|===

* *Major enhancement*: *Import and Export Commands*
** What it does: allows the user to import and export timetables that are in the .ics format.
** Justification: It was a painful process for users to manually add their timeslots using the [https://github.com<TODO>[AddTime Command]].
** Highlights: This enhancement makes use of a third party library to correctly format the .ics file format (given in RFC 5545; https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545). Thus, the project now has an extra dependency. The alternative to a third-party library is writing the code for the formatting by myself; which would be too time consuming.
** Credits: *biweekly third-party library* (https://github.com/mangstadt/biweekly)

* *Minor enhancement*: *Save user's timetable across application instances*.
** What it does: Allows the application to save the timetable into the disk automatically. This means that it can remmeber our users' timetables across restarts.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com<TODO>[Functional code]] [https://github.com<TODO>[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Added 'label' to timeslot, so that users can label the timeslot with the module name. (Pull requests https://github.com[#33])
** Documentation:
*** Created documentation for import, export command and save timetable feature: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (biweekly) to the project (https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-1/main/pull/55[#55])
